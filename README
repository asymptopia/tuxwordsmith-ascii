DESCRIPTION:
A text-based implementation of TuxWordSmith for use in terminal.
Main differences from Scrabble are:
	
	1.  letter distribution computed fairly based on frequency of
		occurance of each letter with respect to installed dictionary.
		
	2.	scoring dynamically computed at runtime based on min/max 
		values configured in config, and letter distribution 
		
	3.	

INSTALLATION:
Just unzip the package wherever you like, cd into the TWS-ASCII 
directory, and run the file TWS.py through your python interpreter
from either a DOS terminal (Windows) or a shell terminal (Linux/Mac).

EXAMPLES:
Windows: C:\Python-2.4\python.exe TWS.py   (use full path).
